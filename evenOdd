Input:
First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase, there will be two line of input, first line of which contains N and next line contains N array elements.

Output:
For each testcase, print the number of odd elements first and then number of even elements seperated by space in a single line.

User Task:
Your task is to complete the function countOddEven() which should print number of odd and number of even elements in a single line seperated by space.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 106
1 <= Ai <= 106

Example:
Input:
1
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output:
3 2
